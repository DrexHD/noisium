### Added

- Lithium compatibility
  - You no longer have to sacrifice fish for performance

### Fixed

- NeoForge 1.20.2+ support
  - Removed the JiJ Mixin Extras, because NeoForge already includes it
- `ChunkSection#populateBiomes` axis order optimisation
  - The optimisation's axis order was incorrect (it was reversed)
  - Thank you to embeddedt for spotting this issue
